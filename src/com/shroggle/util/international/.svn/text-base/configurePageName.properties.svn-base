domainNameText= <p> In order to get your existing domain name to bring up your new web site you will need to provide your&nbsp;\
                domain name registrar with our IP address. </p>\
            <p>IP (66.209.86.46)</p>\
            <p>What is a domain name registrar?<br>\
                The organization responsible for registering your domain name with the proper internet authorities, \
                so that the domain can be found when called by a browser. This is typically the agent through which \
                you purchased your domain name. eg. GoDaddy.com, Yahoo.com etc </p>\
            <p>What is an IP address? <br>\
                It is the address which uniquely identifies the location of the computer where your web site lives.</p>\
            <p>How do I change my IP address?<br>\
                Depending on who you registered your domain with this process can vary. \
                Most larger registrars have a password protected web interface that allows you to log in and edit \
                information yourself. </p>\
            <p>The catch is that there are several terms for this information so to navigate to the appropriate page, \
               you may have to look out for any of the following terms: </p>\
            <p>Domain Details <br>\
                DNS controls <br>\
                'A' records <br>\
                Zone files <br>\
                MX records <br>\
                IP address </p>\
            <p>These tools are generally regarded as 'advanced' domain editing controls and may well be hidden \
               under an 'advanced' tab somewhere. </p>\
            <p>Note that during this process you are likely to come across an interface for editing your 'name server'. \
               You don't need to do this - so don't worry about it, but note that the controls for editing your IP \
               address on GoDaddy.com are actually under the Name Server Summary section.</p>\
            <p>If the domain registrar does not offer this editing interface or if you can't find it on their web site \
               you can typically email or call them.<br>\
               Just ask them to change your IP address to: 66.209.86.46</p>
