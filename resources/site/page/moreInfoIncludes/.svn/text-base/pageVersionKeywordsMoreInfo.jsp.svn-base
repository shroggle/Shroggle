        <div class="pageTitle">'Meta Keywords' Rules:</div>
        <div style="overflow-y: auto; height: 450px; width: 100%;">
            1) Never omit the meta keywords
            <br><br>
            2) 'Meta Keywords' should always be 'unique' (different from your other pages)
            <br><br>
            3) 'Meta Keywords' should generally be about 65 characters, should rarely exceed 85 characters, and should never exceed 120 characters. (including spaces).
            <br><br>
            4) Content of your 'Meta Keywords' should be generally consistent with the content on your page, page titles, page headers, meta descriptions etc. Use similar phrases and words or synonyms within a given page.
            <br><br>
            5) Focus on one concept, don't use this space to cross sell eg. if your page is about 'pens', don't include keywords about paper here.
            <br><br>
            6) Key Phrases should be separated by ',' (commas)
            <br><br>
            7) Don't waste space with generic phrases like: 'Homepage', 'Shopping Cart' or 'More info'. Use only searchable words and phrases.
            <br><br>
            8) We recommend that you don't use your site name or company name, unless it contains the important keywords or key phrases.
            <br><br>
            9) Research your keywords and keyphrases to determine how many people are looking for that term, and how many sites are offering pages that use that term. Check with other people to make sure that the words or phrases means the same thing to your audience that it means to you.
