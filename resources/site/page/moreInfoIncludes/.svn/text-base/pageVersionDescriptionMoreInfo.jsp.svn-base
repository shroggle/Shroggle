            The 'Meta Description' is a real language description of the page, that is put in the code for the search engines to read (index).
            <br><br>
            Search engines use your 'Meta description' in two ways:
            <br><br>
            1) They sometimes display it in their 'search engine results pages' ie. When someone uses a keyword or phrase to search for something in a search engine, the results that display include the 'page titles' and sometimes the 'meta description' for each site in the results.
            <br><br>
            2) Search engines also analyze the contents of your 'meta description' and use this information to determine when and where to place your site in those (natural) search engine results.
            <br><br>
            Building 'Meta Descriptions' for two audiences.
            <br><br>
            There are two audiences to consider when creating your 'meta descriptions'
            <br><br>
            1) Search engines<br>
            2) The people using search engines to search
            <br><br>
            Search engines are looking for 'popular' and 'competitive' keywords
            <br><br>
            Searchers are looking for readable, descriptions of the page content, that captures their attention or 'calls them to action' in some way.
            <br><br>
            But their decision to click on your link in the results is very much influenced by its placement (ie where in the results your site is listed). Therefor, both audiences are important. Furthermore, 'the people' are less likely to see your site at all if the search engine's don't like what they see.
            <br><br>
            'Meta Description' structure:
            <br><br>
            Many discussions of how to structure 'Meta Descriptions' begin with its readability in 'search engine results pages'.
            <br><br>
            However we prefer to structure 'Meta Descriptions' to optimize search engines results.
            (We hold this opinion for the reasons cited above and also because there is a lot of research that suggests that searchers don't 'read' as much as 'react to' search engine results).
            <br><br>
            Whether you are building 'meta descriptions' for search engines to analyze, or for people to read.. the following elements and criteria are essential.
            <br><br>
            1) Never omit the 'meta descripiont'
            <br><br>
            2) 'Meta Description' should always be 'unique' (different from your other pages)
            <br><br>
            3) 'Meta Description' should generally be about 120 characters, should rarely exceed 150 characters, and should never exceed 170 characters. (including spaces). About 22 words maximum.
            <br><br>
            4) Content of your 'Meta Description' should be generally consistent with the content on your page, page headers, meta keywords, page title etc. Use similar phrases and words or synonyms within a given page.
            <br><br>
            5) Focus on one concept, don't use this space to cross sell eg. if your page is about 'pens', don't include keywords about paper here.
            <br><br>
            6) Use Key Phrases in a distilled sentence format. Basically this should be natural language, without word separtors like '|' (pipes). Try using the key phrase as the beginning of a natural language sentence.
            <br><br>
            7) Don't waste space with generic phrases like: 'Homepage', 'Shopping Cart' or 'More info'. Use only searchable words and phrases.
            <br><br>
            8) We recommend that you don't use your site name or company name alone - unless that name describes the page contents optimally. Sometimes it might not be useful to searchers at all. If you do choose to use it, put it at the end of the sentence / list of key phrases.
            <br><br>
            9) Research your keywords and keyphrases to determine how many people are looking for that term, and how many sites are offering pages that use that term. Check with other people to make sure that the words or phrases means the same thing to your audience that it means to you.
            <br><br>
            Because human readability is still important, consider the following elements also:
            <br><br>
            11) Use plain language, and be direct. No puns, no misleading information, no teasers..
            <br><br>
            12) Including a 'Call to action' is sometimes considered to be a good idea. (be careful not to compromise on keyphrase popularity and competitiveness).
            <br><br>
            13) Some people suggest that this is a good place to put your telephone number. (Assuming that is displays in search engine results).
            <br><br>
            14) Make the first word an important, information-carrying one.
