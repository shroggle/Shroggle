            The presence of words in a Domain name (and in a URL) have a good deal of importance for search engine ranking.
            <br><br>
            The words inside your domain and url are used by the search engines as 'keywords or keyphrases'. They will attempt to use these words as indicators of the page subject matter.
            <br><br>
            Logically search engines must be able to 'read' the words in order to do this. (obviously they are not really reading, but the simplification will work for us here).
            <br><br>
            Although this seems to be a simple matter, the truth is that search engins are not very good at parsing language. They confuse the 'characters we put around the words' such as 'hyphens' and numbers, interpreting them as being part of the words.
            <br><br>
            So for example if you happen to sell fence posts and you are fortunate enough to own the domain name 'FencePosts.com' you have a very valuable domain name. However the search engines will not give you much credit for it. They don't recognize 'FencePosts, as being the same thing as 'Fence Posts', and so when someone searches for fence posts, it wont match you up with the searcher on the basis of your domain name. (it may of course do so on the basis of your other site content).
            <br><br>
            This type of domain name is very valuable to the human searcher. It is easier to remember, easier to speak, easier to read, and therefor more likely to be clicked on. So on balance its a good idea to get the domain name without the hyphens.
            <br><br>
            However that is not the end of the discussion, because each of your site pages will have its own URL, (domain name plus the words on the end that identify the web site address of a particular page).
            <br><br>
            This is somewhere you can make use of carefully chosen word separators while not having to worry too much about human readability.
            <br><br>
            Google (and MSN, Yahoo) favor the following naming systems:
            <br><br>
            Plus: <a href="http://www.domain.com/word1+word2.htm">http://www.domain.com/word1+word2.htm</a><br>
            Hyphen: <a href="http://www.domain.com/word1-word2.htm">http://www.domain.com/word1-word2.htm</a><br>
            Using <b>-</b> or <b>+</b> will help the search engines to parse the separate words in your url.
            <br><br>
            As mentioned above don't try to concatenate words without word separators. And don't try to use other characters such as numbers, underscores (_) or ampersands (&) as word separators because that doesn't work.
            <br><br>
            <b>So for example, DONT do this:</b>
            <br><br>
            <a href="http://www.fenceposts.com/wordword.html">http://www.fenceposts.com/wordword.html</a> or<br>
            <a href="http://www.fenceposts.com/word00word.html">http://www.fenceposts.com/word00word.html</a> or<br>
            <a href="http://www.domain.com/word1_word2.html">http://www.domain.com/word1_word2.html</a>
        </div>
