            The 'Page Title' will be displayed in the page code: Browsers display it in the title bar of the visitors browser window.
            <br><br>
            Search engines use your 'Page title' in two ways:
            <br>
            1) They display it in their 'search engine results pages' ie. When someone uses a keyword or phrase to search for something in a search engine, the results that display include the 'page titles' for each site in the results.
            <br><br>
            2) Search engines also analyze the contents of your 'page title' and use this information to determine when and where to place your site in those (natural) search engine results.
            <br><br>
            Building 'Page Titles' for two audiences.
            <br><br>
            Therefore there are two audiences to consider when creating your 'page titles'
            <br><br>
            1) Search engines
            <br><br>
            2) The people using search engines to search
            <br><br>
            Search engines are looking for 'popular' and 'competitive' keywords
            <br><br>
            Searchers are looking for readable, descriptions of the page content, that captures their attention and arguably provides some info about the context of the page (site name, what part of the site the page relates to).
            <br><br>
            But their decision to click on your link in the results is very much influenced by its placement (ie where in the results your site is listed). Therefor, both audiences are important. Furthermore, 'the people' are less likely to see your site in the search engine results if the search engine's don't like what they see.
            <br><br>
            'Page Title' structure:
            <br><br>
            Many discussions of how to structure 'page titles' begin with its readability in 'search engine results pages'.
            <br><br>
            However we prefer to structure 'Page Titles' to optimize search engines results.
            (We do for the reasons cited above and also because there is a lot of recent research that suggests that searchers don't 'read' as much as 'react to' search engine results).
            <br><br>
            Whether you are building 'page titles for search engines to analyze or people to read.. the following elements and criteria are essential.
            <br><br>
            1) Never omit the page title
            <br><br>
            2) Page title should always be 'unique' (different from your other pages)
            <br><br>
            3) Page titles should generally be about 65 characters, should rarely exceed 85 characters, and should never exceed 120 characters. (including spaces).
            <br><br>
            4) Content of your 'Page title' should be generally consistent with the content on your page, page headers, meta tags, page description etc. Use similar phrases and words or synonyms within a given page.
            <br><br>
            5) Focus on one concept, don't use this space to cross sell eg. if your page is about 'pens', don't include keywords about paper here.
            <br><br>
            6) Key Phrases should be separated by '|' (there are a lot of opinions about what separators to use, but 'pipes' as they are called look good, are easy enough to understand and work well for search engines). (you will find this character on your keyboard above the 'enter' key.
            <br><br>
            7) Don't waste space with generic phrases like: 'Homepage', 'Shopping Cart' or 'More info'. Use only searchable words and phrases.
            <br><br>
            8) We recommend that you don't use your site name or company name on its own - unless that name describes the page contents optimally. Sometimes it might not be useful to searchers at all. If you do choose to use it, put it at the end of the list of key phrases.
            <br><br>
            9) Structure your page titles consistently from page to page (eg. don't use '|' separators on one page and '/' on the next page)
            <br><br>
            10) Research your keywords and keyphrases to determine how many people are looking for that term, and how many sites are offering pages that use that term. Check with other people to make sure that the words or phrases means the same thing to your audience that it means to you.
            <br><br>
            Because human readability is still important, consider the following elements also:
            <br><br>
            11) 'Page titles' should be little jewels: Clear descriptions of page content / theme, that use only relevant keyphrases, and all of that in 65 characters including spaces. (omiting articles (the, and etc)
            <br><br>
            12) Use plain language, and be direct. No puns, no misleading information, no teasers..
            <br><br>
            13) Including a 'Call to action' is sometimes considered to be a good idea. (be careful not to compromise on keyphrase popularity and competitiveness).
            <br><br>
            14) Make the first word an important, information-carrying one.
            <br><br>
            15) Consider including the site name at the end of each 'page title', to build brand awareness and recognition. (be careful not to waist limited character space with names / words that wont rank well).
            <br><br>
            16) Browsers generally cut off a long 'page title' at either 66 or 75 characters, so for your readers it is best to check that the page title ends elegantly at
        </div>
        <br clear="all">

        <div class="buttons_box">
            <input type="button" onclick="closeConfigureWidgetDiv();" value="Close"
                                onmouseout="this.className='but_w73';"
                                onmouseover="this.className='but_w73_Over';" class="but_w73">
        </div>
